This repository contains the code that ran the user study described in HRI19's **From One to Another: How Robot-Robot Interaction Affects Usersâ€™ Perceptions Following a Transition Between Robots** by **Tan et al. (2019)**. Due to the experimental nature of the work, the code does not meet industry coding guidelines / best practices and would need modifications to work on different machines. We provided a brief guide and pointers on how the system work and requires hardwares.
